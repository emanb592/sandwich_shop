SANDWICH SHOP.

# Sandwich Shop

A small Flutter demo app that lets you build and preview sandwich orders. The app demonstrates a simple stateful UI for adding/removing sandwiches, selecting bread type, toggling between "six-inch" and "footlong" sizes, and adding an optional order note.

Key features
- Add and remove sandwich items with simple enable/disable logic tied to a max quantity.
- Select bread from a DropdownMenu (white / wheat / brown / wholemeal).
- Toggle sandwich size between six-inch and footlong.
- Enter an order note and see it reflected immediately in the display.
- Small, testable codebase with unit and widget tests.

Quick links to important source files

  - Android: Android SDK and a device/emulator or Android Studio.
  - iOS (macOS only): Xcode and a device/simulator.
  - Web: a modern browser.
  - Desktop (optional): Linux, macOS, or Windows toolchains set up for Flutter desktop. See Flutter docs for desktop setup.

Notable tests:

Notes and tips

The app is intentionally simple for learning and demonstration purposes.
To change the default max quantity for test/dev, pass maxQuantity into the OrderScreen constructor in lib/main.dart or change the default in the constructor.
To modify visual styling, edit lib/views/app_styles.dart and restart the app.
